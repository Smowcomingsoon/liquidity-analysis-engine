"""Arenas: the Top by narrative instead of one Top 15/25/50.

Lorenzo, 07/10: "la top50 come concetto e' limitante, serve un sistema
meritocratico [...] data la complessita' dei progetti e le diverse
narrative", then "procedi come consigliato". An AI-agent token, an L1 chain
and an RWA project no longer sit in one row: each competes only with its
peers, in the arena of one of its narratives (layer chains have their own).

- No fixed size: an arena holds every project that passed the gates, and
  the ones at or above the arena's median are "in"; the rest sit on its
  bench. A strong arena can have twelve, a weak one two.
- A project with several narratives competes where it beats its peers by
  the most (score minus the arena's median).
- Pound for pound: the projects that lead their own arena by the most, in
  spreads from its median; one per arena. A small project that dominates
  its niche beats a big one in the middle of its own.
- The ladder (record_night): each night every project duels up to
  DUELS_PER_NIGHT peers of its arena, block by block (usage, participation,
  product, token, DeepSeek), and an Elo rating keeps the result. Recorded
  from the first night, shown once it has settled (LADDER_READY_NIGHTS):
  a lucky night is worth a few points, not the top place.
