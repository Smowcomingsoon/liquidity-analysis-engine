"""The Gem Finder's memory of every project it has ever met: a database.

Request: "il gem hunter deve trovare progetti di qualita', ma vedi sempre i
soliti... ma fatti un database no?". Why the board kept showing the same
names: the finder had no memory of the market, only of its board.

- A project was examined only when a source handed it over at the right
  moment (a CoinGecko category page, a DexScreener profile, a README), and
  CoinGecko was read only through the "solana-ecosystem" category, which
  lists a fraction of the Solana coins CoinGecko knows.
- The working set held 400 projects; older ones were dropped and forgotten.
- One rejection was final for 30 days, whatever changed after.

Here every project from every source is written once and kept: identity,
links, which sources saw it, the market (cap, liquidity, volume), and the
last analysis (pillars, score, verdict and why). The board's working set is
fed from here by priority, a rejected project is looked at again after
RECHECK_S (a repository gets commits, a site gets docs), and the whole
database can be searched from the app: nothing examined is lost.

SQLite on the volume, like the order ledger: one process, one writer,
atomic upserts, and a file that survives deploys.
