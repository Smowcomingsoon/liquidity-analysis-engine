"""Catalogo dei 151 indicatori di pandas-ta, con classificazione per il grafico.

pandas-ta e' gia' una dipendenza (vedi indicators.py, che ne usa solo 6 dei
151 disponibili). Questo modulo espone gli altri: un registro che dice per
ciascuno come chiamarlo, se va disegnato sul prezzo o in un riquadro separato,
e quali parametri ha senso esporre in UI. Il frontend lo usa per popolare la
libreria a tendina; nessun indicatore viene calcolato finche' l'utente non lo
sceglie esplicitamente, cosi' /api/analyze non si appesantisce.
